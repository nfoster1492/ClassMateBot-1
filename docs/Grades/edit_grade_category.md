# How to run it? (Small Example)
You are in the server that has the Classmate Bot active and online. You are an Instructor. From the instructor commands channel, enter the command `$edit_grade_category <category_name> <weight>` with the desired category name and weight.

```

Successful execution of this command will edit a grade category in the database with the new desired weight. The bot will report on the success or failure of the command.
